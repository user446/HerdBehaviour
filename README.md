# HerdBehaviourTest
Simple herd behaviour sample project  
  
Project includes two sample teams (as Scriptable Objects) to what players can be assigned, and one scene with 3 vs.3 playres (Red Cubes and Yellow Spheres).  
Players are able to share enemy targets between team mates. By default players search for an enemy inside one radius and start to attack an enemy if it is inside another one. Nearest enemy is chosen by default.  
If for some reason player do not have a target it gets random target from opposite team.  
Number of players and teams is not constrained.  

Run ./Build/3dHyper.exe to play the game
